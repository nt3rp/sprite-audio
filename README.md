# sprite-audio

A simple set of tools to take some audio source in a browser (e.g. file, or microphone) and use that source as input to
animate a sprite.

## Motivation

While working on a [podcast with some friends](http://soundcloud.com/thenickscast), we talked about putting it up on
Youtube. I felt that, rather than have a static image for the podcast, it would add some personality to animate our
voices. However, I didn't feel like doing the animation by hand, so I started to make this to automate the process.

## Installation

``` bash
# Install all dependencies and build the application
> npm install
```

## API Reference

TBD

## Tests

Not at the moment, I'm afraid
